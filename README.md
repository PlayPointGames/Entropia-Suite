# Entropia-Suite

Tools for tracking your results in Entropia Universe.

In the initial phase we will develop a simple hunting loot tracker.

The complete set of tools will consist of the following modules:

- Hunting
- Mining
- Crafting
- Trading

## Ideas

Paid hunting, possibilities:
- 0.1pec for running the software for an hour (max 10 hours a day = 1pec)
- Percentage of decay, up to 1pec/day (would be potentially faster to get 1pec than waiting it out?)
- Global based?

How to control for the real use of the tool (vs. sending fake data to the server)?
- Cross reference sent global data
- Still can't be sure if the user is actually using the tool, only that it's running and he is online in Entropia 
- Smart user can still send fake dmg/loot messages to the server while providing accurate global data in real time
- Random screenshots(???) could feel like it's intrusive but we could also auto-censor certain areas of the display
